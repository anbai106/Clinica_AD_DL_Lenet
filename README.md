# Documentation

This code relies either on the [Clinica software platform](http://www.clinica.run) that you will need to install. The T1-weighted MRI should be first preprocessed by Clinica (http://clinica.run) software using **t1-freesurfer-cross-sectional** pipeline. The resulting image was further extracted into slices and saved into binary file.
